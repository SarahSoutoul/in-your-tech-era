# In Your Tech Era – Client Portal & Mentorship Dashboard ✨ 

Welcome to the heart of my mentorship platform 👩‍💻💫  

This is the dashboard I built to support women breaking into tech — a space to track progress, access resources, and stay connected between sessions. 

## 💖 What This Project Means to Me

I didn’t start in tech — I studied journalism and came into code through storytelling. Learning to code changed my life, and this project is a *love letter to that journey*. It’s for people like me — women who didn’t always see themselves as “technical” or feel like they belonged in the tech world.

When I became a tech educator, I started dreaming about building something of my own — a *coding space for women to learn, grow, and feel like they belong*. I’ve seen firsthand the challenges women face in tech, and I wanted to create an environment where they feel empowered, not intimidated.

The most rewarding part of my work has always been watching my students transform. I’ve seen women walk into class with almost no confidence, saying things like “I’m just not smart enough” or “I feel so stupid”. And every single time, my heart breaks a little because I've been there too. But then, they grow into bold, brilliant developers who know their worth and thrive in their roles. That transformation means everything to me. It proves the power of mentoring and helping others navigate their own tech journeys. So often, it starts just by seeing someone who looks like them in front of the class. Representation *matters*. It’s a quiet but powerful reminder: *you belong here*.

Even now, as someone who’s taught hundreds of students and worked as a software engineer, I still feel imposter syndrome. The truth is, almost every woman I’ve met in tech has felt that same fear, whether they’re two years in or thirty. This project is a small part of a dream I've had since becoming an educator. It's for all of the women I´ve mentored so far, and the ones I've yet to meet. It’s a space built with care, to *support women in tech in a way that feels empowering, human, and real*. Because we all deserve to have our *tech era* 💪
