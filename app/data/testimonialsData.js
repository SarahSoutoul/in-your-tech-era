      "I've not been in an educational environment where I felt like someone cared about me and my classmates as much as Sarah did. I really felt like Sarah always went above and beyond to help us: the content always felt like it was thought through and prepared, she sent us extra resources and checked in if I'd mentioned that I was feeling overwhelmed or struggling with a concept. I also really appreciated that she would always give honest feedback - it always felt like she was treating us as adults. That made me feel comfortable asking for help or having conversations if I was worried or struggling with something. One to one's, help with technical interviews or just an encouraging word, so helpful. Thank you Sarah!",

      'Sarah was amazing! Her style of teaching was a massive reason to my success at the academy. She spoke with clarity and confidence and made sure no student was left behind by checking if everyone was okay at certain checkpoints during lessons. She made us all feel very comfortable during an intense 12 weeks and was always there for support whenever we needed outside of classes. She made the learning fun with her continuous jokes and also moved through topics in a swift manner so nothing felt dragged on.',

      'She was amazing! Sarah went above and beyond making sure that we could understand and be comfortable and confident with all of the concepts. Her style of teaching was really good as well, broken up into a lot of mini-exercises and questioning. Sarah always knew when someone was having difficulty with the content and she would go out of her way to set up a 1 to 1 to help go over what they needed.',

      'Sarah is very knowledgeable, down to earth and supportive. She always ensured every student was on the same page and would put extra time aside to support anyone struggling with the curriculum or who needed emotional support. She was also very present after the course ended and provided extra content and advice to be prepared for placements. She always went above and beyond! She is a star.',
